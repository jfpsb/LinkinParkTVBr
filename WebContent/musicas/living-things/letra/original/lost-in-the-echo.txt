<h2>Lost In The Echo</h2>
<pre>You were that / foundation
Never gonna be another one no
I followed / so taken
So conditioned I could never let go
Then sorrow / then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow / so vicious
So afraid I couldn’t let myself see
That I could never be held
Back or up no / I hold myself
Check the rep / yep you know mine well
Forget the rest / let them know my hell
There and back / yet my soul ain’t sell
Kept respect up / the best they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there saying . . .

In these promises broken / deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie / I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go

Test my will / test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Ya’ll go hard / I go smart
How’s that working out for y’all in the back, huh?
I’ve seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I’ve come back / unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don’t hold back I hold my own
I can’t be mapped / I can’t be cloned
I can’t C-flat / it ain’t my tone
I can’t fall back I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
’Cause I was there saying. . .

NO / YOU CAN TELL ’EM ALL NOW
I DON’T BACK UP / I DON’T BACK DOWN
I DON’T FOLD UP AND I DON’T BOW
I DON’T ROLL OVER / DON’T KNOW HOW
I DON’T CARE WHERE THE ENEMIES ARE
CAN’T BE STOPPED / ALL I KNOW / GO HARD
WON’T FORGET HOW I GOT THIS FAR
FOR EVERY TIME SAYING

In these promises broken / deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie / I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go</pre>
