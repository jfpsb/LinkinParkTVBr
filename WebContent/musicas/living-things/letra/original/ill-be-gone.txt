<h2>I'll Be Gone</h2>
<pre>Like shining oil this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down
Glistening
And I’m trying not to think what I’m leaving now
No deceiving now
It’s time you let me know
Let me know

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone

This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now
Bittersweet
And ’cross that horizon this sun is setting down
You’re forgetting now
It’s time you let me go
Let me go

And tell them I couldn’t help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh tell me I am the only one
And there’s nothing that can stop me

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone</pre>
