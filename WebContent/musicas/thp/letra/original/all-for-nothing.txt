<h2>All For Nothing</h2>
<pre>So what ’cha waiting for
Anticipating more
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war
Yeah I been hated more than time I wasn’t hated for
There’s nothing they can fucking say they didn’t say before
But you could never see it
Your battle’s not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe but this is take a shot time
While you’re waiting for a purpose I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4
 
And if I do what you demand
(You say) You’ll let me understand
(You say) You’re gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say) I’ll have no debt to pay
(You say) I’m gonna get what I deserve
 
YOUR WORD / OBEYED
MY DEBT / REPAID
OUR TRUST / BETRAYED
ALL FOR NOTHING
ALL FOR NOTHING
 
Kick back there’s no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya
I really don’t know ya
You talk but let me show ya where to put your paranoia
You’re joking, I don’t have a half a sucker bone to throw ya
I’m disgusted, wonder what could’ve made ya tuck your tail below ya
And no I’m not your soldier I’m not taking any orders
I’m a five star general, infantry controller
Need a lesson?  Let me show ya
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4</pre>
