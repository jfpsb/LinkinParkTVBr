<h2>Lying From You</h2>
<pre>When I pretend
Everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend
I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just ’cause I know I can / but
I can’t pretend this is the way it will stay / I’m just
Trying to bend the truth
I can’t pretend i’m who you want me to be
So I’m

Lying my way from you

[No / No turning back now]
I wanna be pushed aside
So let me go
[No / No turning back now]
Let me take back my life
I’d rather be all alone
[No turning back now]
Anywhere on my own
‘Cause I can see
[No / No turning back now]
The very worst part of you
Is me

I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in
And now you think this person really is me and I’m
[Trying to bend the truth]
But the more I push
The more I’m pulling away
‘Cause I’m

Lying my way from you

This isn’t what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this

The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you
Is me</pre>
