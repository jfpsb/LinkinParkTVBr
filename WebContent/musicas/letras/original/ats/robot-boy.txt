<h2>Robot Boy</h2>
<pre>You say / you’re not gonna fight / ’cause no one will fight for you
And you think / there’s not enough love / and no one to give it to
And you’re sure / you’ve hurt for so long / you’ve got nothing left to lose
So you say / you’re not gonna fight / ’cause no one will fight for you

You say / the weight of the world / has kept you from letting go
And you think / compassion’s a flaw / and you’ll never let it show
And you’re sure / you’ve hurt in a way / that no one will ever know
But someday / the weight of the world / will give you the strength to go

Hold on / the weight of the world / will give you the strength to go
So hold on / the weight of the world / will give you the strength to go
So hold on / the weight of the world / will give you the strength to go
Just hold on / the weight of your world / will give you the strength to go</pre>
