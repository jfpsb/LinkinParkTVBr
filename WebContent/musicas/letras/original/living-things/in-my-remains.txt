<h2>In My Remains</h2>
<pre>Separate
Sifting through the wreckage I canâ€™t concentrate
Searching for a message in the fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for a chance to feel alive

Now in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Come apart
Falling in the cracks of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting for a chance to feel alive

Now in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Like an army
Falling
One by one by one</pre>
