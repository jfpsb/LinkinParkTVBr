<h2>Valentine's Day</h2>
<pre>My insides all turn to ash
So slow
And blew away as I collapsed
So Cold
A black wind took them away
From sight
Another darkness over day
That night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

I used to be my own protection
But not now
Because my path has lost direction
Somehow

A black wind took you away
From sight
Another darkness over day
That night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

So now you’re gone
And I was wrong
I never knew what it was like
To be alone…

On a valentine’s day
On a valentine’s day
On a valentine’s day
On a valentine’s day

I used to be my own protection
But not now
Because my mind has lost direction
Somehow

I used to be my own protection
But not now
Because my mind has lost direction
Somehow</pre>
