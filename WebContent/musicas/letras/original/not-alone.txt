<h2>Not Alone</h2>
<pre>I break down / fear is sinking in
The cold comes / racing through my skin
Searching for / a way to get to you
through the storm

you
go / giving up your home
go / leaving all you’ve known
You are not alone

With arms up / stretched into the sky
With eyes like / echoes in the night
Hiding from / the hell that you’ve been through
Silent one

you
go / giving up your home
go / leaving all you’ve known
you
go / giving up your home
go / leaving all you’ve known
You are not alone

you
go / giving up your home
go / leaving all you’ve known
you
go / giving up your home
go / you are not unknown
You are not alone
You are not unknown
You are not alone</pre>
