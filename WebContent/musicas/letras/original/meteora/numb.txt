<h2>Numb</h2>
<pre>I’m tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless
Lost under the surface
I don’t know what you’re expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes

[Caught in the undertow / Just caught in the undertow]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

I’ve
Become so numb
I can’t feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I’m becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

Can’t you see that you’re smothering me
Holding too tightly
Afraid to lose control
‘Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

[Caught in the undertow / Just caught in the undertow]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
[Caught in the undertow / Just caught in the undertow]
And every second I waste is more than I can take

But I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me
With someone disappointed in you</pre>
