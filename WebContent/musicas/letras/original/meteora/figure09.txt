<pre>Nothing ever stops all these thoughts
And the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
It’s like nothing I can do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
‘Cause from the infinite words I could say / I
Put all the pain you gave to me on display / but didn’t
Realize / instead of setting it free / I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

[It never goes away]

Hearing your name / The memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I’d see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away I was
Committing myself to them / And every day I
Regret saying those things / ’cause now I see / that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

[It never goes away]

And now
You’ve become a part of me
You’ll always be right here
You’ve become a part of me
You’ll always be my fear
I can’t separate myself from what I’ve done
I’ve given up a part of me
I’ve let myself become you

Get away from
Me
Gimme my space back / You gotta just
Go
Everything comes down to memories of
You
I’ve kept it in but now I’m letting you
Know
I’ve let you go
Get away frm me

I’ve let myself become you
I’ve let myself become lost inside these
Thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me
I’ve let myself become you</pre>
