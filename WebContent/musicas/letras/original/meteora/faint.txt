<h2>Faint</h2>
<pre>I am
Little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
A handful of complaints
But I can’t help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am
What I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it’s like
No matter what I do
I can’t convince you
To just believe this is real
So I let go
Watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I’m not
But I’ll be here
‘Cause you’re all I got

I am
A little bit insecure
A little unconfident
‘Cause you don’t understand
I do what I can
But sometimes I don’t make sense
I am
What you never want to say
But I’ve never had a doubt
It’s like no matter what I do
I can’t convince you
For once just to hear me out
So I let go
Watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I’m not
But I’ll be here
‘Cause you’re all I got

I can’t feel
The way I did before
Don’t turn your back on me
I won’t be ignored
Time won’t heal
This damage anymore
Don’t turn your back on me
I won’t be ignored</pre>
