<h2>Nobody's Listening</h2>
<pre>Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut
Over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like
[Rewind that]
We’re just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten
But still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those who wanna
Talk this and that / So I suppose
It gets to a that point feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt
[It goes]

Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
[Told you everything loud and clear]
But nobody’s listening
Call to you so clearly
But you don’t want to hear me
[Told you everything loud and clear]
But nobody’s listening

I got a
Heart full of pain / Head full of stress
Handful of anger / Held in my chest
And everything left is a waste of time
I hate my rhymes
[But hate everyone else's more]
I’m riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that it’s better
I can’t keep myself together
Because all of this stress
Gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood sweat and tears
The uphill struggle over years
The fear and trash talking
And the people it was to
And the people that started it
Just like you

I got a
Heart full of pain / Head full of stress
Handful of anger / Held in my chest
Uphill struggle / Blood sweat and tears
Nothing to gain / Everything to fear
