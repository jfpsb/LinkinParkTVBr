<h2>Blue (1998 Unreleased Hybrid Theory DEMO)</h2>
<pre>In the dark days, I'll part ways with the blame.
Trying to maintain, but it's still all the same, It's all a game.
Hear my name in the rain and the pain, I wear on my face with a tear stain
You feign fondness, honestly it's time to give you a piece of my mind
and show you that you're blind.
And in the design of the world I call mine, know that you can't stand
on both sides of the line.

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Problems have two faces

Pass all the blame over to me, it will come eventually
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly

With my eyes shut, I'm seeing the truth in your words
The absurd, slurred into beauty to be heard
You swim through deceit, the lies that you tell
The stories you sell, knowing you well, I keep distance
And every instance you keep your thoughts concealed
What I feel, just another spoke in the wheel
All or nothing, thrown down and trampled by your heel
And eaten away by my own version of the real

Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly

Who is to blame?

Nothing, thrown down
It's all the same, just pass me the blame
Trampled by your heal
Play the game and wear a tear stain
Eaten by my own
Pass the blame cause you'll feel it if you don't
Version of the real
Always to blame
