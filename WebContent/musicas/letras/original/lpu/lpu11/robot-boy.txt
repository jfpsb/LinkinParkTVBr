<h2>Robot Boy (Test Mix, Optional Vocal Take)</h2>
<pre>You say you're not gonna fight 'cause no one will fight for you
'Cause you think there's not enough love and no one to give it to
And you say that faith is a lie, and fear is your only truth
And you're sure that everyone else is feeling the way you do

You say you've hurt for so long that pain isn't something new
But don't think the things that they've done, predict what you're going to do
The truth is that trust is a gift, it's something we all can lose
So hold on, it's not where it goes, it's where it can lead you to

Hold on, it's not where it goes, it's where it can lead you to</pre>
