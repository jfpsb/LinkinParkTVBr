<h2>Slip (1998 Unreleased Hybrid Theory DEMO)</h2>
<pre>In the center of the silence, violent thoughts are thrown through
The thick smoke and flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say
Get lost and thrown away
You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind
Can't turn back when you cross the line
Sometimes it's someone you know who just doesn't care
Has to see you go to know you were there

This is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back 
When I begin it
Know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back 
When I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong

Sometimes you've got no control of where you go
Taking you down a road you don't know
And you feel so lost that you wanna hide your face
You don't recognize the place you're in
Sometimes the sun doesn't shine your way
Sometimes the night doesn't turn to day
Sometimes the light's so bright it burns through the night and keeps the darkness at bay
(Runaway)

This is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back 
When I begin it
Know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back 
When I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them with me

Follow the link in the chain without a name
Seal the light and the darkened days remains
Taken away from the place you've been trapped
Break all you know then bring it all back

This is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back 
When I begin it
Know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back 
When I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them alone with me</pre>
