<h2>Esaul (A Place For My Head DEMO)</h2>
<pre>Writing with a head full of buckets of red
And what I said still stuck in my head
A thoroughbred, thoroughly bled
And led to the land where they never come back
Smaller than a thumbtack, yet they never run from that
From planetary signs, rising over the horizon, smaller than a fly stand
I'm a lyrical lamb, the power of a god
In my cynical hand, with a pen, once again
Swimming in the centre of the hit or a miss
Reeling in my thoughts, getting lost in the mist
Realizing one not the size of a fist
And the killing of the killer with the flick of the wrist

I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still I see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

And the second it's gone, the weapon of time
Is stronger than a nuclear bomb, eternity or half-life
Something that math can't write, you can't fight nor flee
Still be around if it wasn't for me
Weigh that / verse whatever, my friends
So you can see the attraction of the payback
Don't want me to say that? Play back the thing now
Getting lost in the chaos, tossing it down
Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic of my confine
Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic of my confine

I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still I see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds

I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still I see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Burn!
Burn!
Burn!

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
