<h2>In The End (DEMO)</h2>
<pre>It starts with one / And multiplies 'til you can taste the sun
And burnt by the sky you tried to take it from
But, if it falls, there's no place to run
Crumbling down / It's so unreal
They're dealing you in to determine your end
And sending you back again to places you've been
And bending your will / 'til it breaks you within
And, still, they fill their eyes
With the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on pad with the way I feel
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness / But I know that I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've looked down the line / And what's there is not what ought to be
Held back by the battles they fought for me
Calling me to be part of their property
And, now, I see that I get no chance
I get no break / Fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes
And, as the tightrope within / Slowly starts to thin
I can only hope that they close their eyes
To the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a path through the way I feel
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness / But I know that I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter</pre>
