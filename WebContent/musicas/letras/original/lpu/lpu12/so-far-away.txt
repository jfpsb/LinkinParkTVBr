<h2>So Far Away (Unreleased 1998)</h2>
<pre>Save me now / from this mess that I've created
All the souls have gone / and I'm stranded here with doubt and fear alone

Tell me how / I'm in fault for all this madness
I don't know what's wrong / but I cannot help but try to push it

So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it anyway)

Save me now / I'm the mess I have created
And my soul has gone / for some reason all I do is push it

So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it anyway)
So far away

[Scratching]

It's so far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it anyway)
So far away
(In so deep and inside of me)
So hard to say
(I don't want to say it anyway)</pre>
