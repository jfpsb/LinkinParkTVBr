<h2>Forgotten (DEMO)</h2>
<pre>From the top to the bottom
(Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten
(In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety
(Saw a light in the sky)
The sun won't escape me
(So why did I try?)
(x2)

From the thread to the needle, middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes tightly shut
looking through the rust and rot and dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours itself upon the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and its dark again

(Pre-chorus)

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go round and the sunset creeps past the
street lamps, cars, chain-link and concrete
A window then grows and catches the eye
Cries out a yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothing stops in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And then the insides change
The box stays the same
The shame, shovel up the pieces of the pain
You can try to hide yourself in this world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

(Pre-chorus)

(Chorus)

Now I got you caught in the act
You better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(x2)

Now I got you caught in the act
You better step back [BACK]
I'm telling you that I see it right through you [THROUGH YOU]
(x2)

(Are you afraid of you)
Now I got you got in the act
You better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(Afraid of you)
Now I got you got in the act
You better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
(x2)

(Chorus x2)</pre>
