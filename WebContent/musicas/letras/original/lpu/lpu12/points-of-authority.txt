<pre>Forfeit the game
Before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

I won't believe a word you say
I'll cut to pieces by the sound of every breath you take
Swimming through a sea of hurt
My life, my pride is stronger
