<h2>Step Up / Nobody's Listening / It's Going Down</h2>
<pre>Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up ("Here we go!")

Step, step up, step, step up ("Shh...")

Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed media slangs, banging in your boom box
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish
You can’t tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn’t make you an emcee
Lack of skills and facility, you’re killing me
And a DJ in your group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are getting help wit your rhymes
You’re not an emcee if someone else writes your lines
Rappin' over rock doesn’t make you a pioneer
‘cause rock and hip hop collaborated for years
But now they’re getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up?
None of it’s real
You want to be an emcee to help us out, y'all, come on!

("Check this out.")

C-c-c-c-c-coming at you, coming at you, com--, coming at you

Yo/peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is
How could you ignore it
LP right back in the cut
Over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like rewind that
Just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
These non-stop lyrics of life-living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime, there are those who wanna
Talk this and that/so I suppose
Gets to a point, feelings got to get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt
("Chester!")

Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
["You sing" Told you everything loud and clear but]
(obody's listening)
Call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
[I told you everything loud and clear but]
(Nobody's listening)

("Yep! This song is called "It's Going Down"! You ready? Help me out, y'all! When I say "It's Goin'", you say "Down"! It's Goin' (Down), It's Goin' (Down)! When I say "It's Goin'", you say "Down"! It's Goin' (Down), It's Goin' (Down), When I say "It's Goin'", you say "Down"! It's Goin' (Down)! It's Goin' (Down)! When I say "It's Goin'", everybody "Down"! It's Goin' (Down)! Check it out.")

It's goin' down
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detects the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futuresque style
Combination of vocal caress
With lungs the gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage
It's going down
Logical progression on the timeline
Separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey now

It's goin' down
Logical progression on the timeline
Separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
("You guys ready?!")-Take you on an audible odyssey now-("Come on!")

Out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
(It's goin' down)
Nobody in the world is safe
We melt down the wax in your record crate

("Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for our DJ, he goes by the name of Mr. Hahn! You want to listen to a bit of Mr. Hahn right now? We'll do it like this, and drop the beat now, come on! Mr. Hahn! Los Angeles! If you're feeling that, then make some noise! Yes?! People make some noise, go! People on this side, make some noise! Thank you guys very much. Thanks.")</pre>
