<h2>Apaches - Until It Breaks DEMO No. 1</h2>
<pre>It goes one, two, three
I was born with the hunger of a lion / the strength of a sun
I don’t need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don’t run the track, no / I make the track run
My mama taught me words / my daddy built rockets
I put ’em both together now tell me what I got
It’s a pretty smart weapon / I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it ’cause you clearly can’t stop it
Like that

It ain’t over ’cause the
Shark’s on the left side / the snake’s on the right
And anything you do they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn’t matter if you’re wrong or if you’re right
’Cause once they get their teeth in / nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you can try to fill my shoes, but
Steady little soldier, I ain’t standing next to you
I’d be laying on the ground before you’re even in my view
Like that
