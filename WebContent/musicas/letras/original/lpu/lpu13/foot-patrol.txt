<h2>Foot Patrol - Until It Breaks DEMO No. 2</h2>
<pre>You don't give a damn about the blood and sweat that I spilled
To make it so I'm standing right here
But you can bet your soul and your faith in God that I will
Not fold in the face of this fear
'Cause I won't be intimidated by you / push down and lied to
I'm not a fool or a punk
And you can try to bruise me and break me 
but please don't mistake me
And see if I don't get right back up

Now / now see if I don't get right back up
Now / now see if I don't get right back up
Now / now see if I don't get right back up
Now / now see if I don't get right back up

(Break)

It’s something for your people on the block to
Black out and rock to
Give me what you need like papa, who shot ya
“Separate the weak from the obsolete”
You're meek / I creep hard on imposters
And switch styles on the dime / quick-witted
Ya'll, quit trippin’ I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough / sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup?
Bang bang little monkey man
Playing with the big guns only get you stain, I ain't playing
I'm just saying / you ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake shake down / money, here's the breakdown
You can play the bank I'ma play the bank take-down
And no mistakes now / coming to get ya
I'm just a Banksy / you're a Brainwash
Get the picture?
It's like that</pre>
