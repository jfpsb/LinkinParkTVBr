<h2>Faint (Demo 2002)</h2>
<pre>Back, before I say good-bye 
Just as the first day turned to night 
Just as the concrete turned to dust 
And the steel turned into rust 
All I could think was a new way to dig through the damage 
Couldn't think of a way to get through this 
Now I see you taking advantage 
And I find another reason to do this 
I'm thinking there's a hole to travel through 
I wanna find a way to rattle you 
You wanna try to hit the thunder hit 
You're gonna have to follow me under it 
Let go, its begun 
Close your eyes, I'm not done 
Breath the word, Waste your breath 
And keep it up 'til there's nothing left

Now that I said good-bye 
Just as the darkness turned to light 
Just as the next light turns to day 
And the world gets under way 
Now all I can see is the answer to the patient waiting to take this out on the wind of the raindrops 
And I waited patiently taking it in 
Ready for the first of the face-offs 
I'm thinking there's a hole to travel through 
I wanna find a way to rattle you 
You wanna try to hit the thunder hit 
You're gonna have to follow me under it 
Let go, its begun 
Close your eyes, I'm not done 
Breath the word, Waste your breath 
And keep it up 'til there's nothing left

I'm thinking there's a hole to travel through 
I wanna find a way to rattle you 
You wanna try to hit the thunder hit 
You're gonna have to follow me under it 
I'm thinking there's a hole to travel through 
I wanna find a way to rattle you 
You wanna try to hit the thunder hit 
You're gonna have to follow me under it 
I'm thinking there's a hole to travel through 
I wanna find a way to rattle you 
You wanna try to hit the thunder hit 
You're gonna have to follow me under it 
Let go, its begun 
Close your eyes, I'm not done 
Breath the word, Waste your breath 
And keep it up 'til there's nothing left</pre>
