<h2>QWERTY</h2>
<pre>Your lies

I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Till they came to take all I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow 'till it followed you home
And like that

Broken down, a victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside
That cold disguise
Behind your lies

I don't know what I thought I might say
Seems like we never would talk the right way
Every other minute I fought for my place
And drop what I made thought you might say so
I'm guessing that you probably know
When your inside's hollow and you want to be cold
Like a pill hard to swallow and it swallowed me whole
Another lie hard to follow 'till it followed me home
And like that

Broken down, a victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside
That cold disguise
Behind your lies

You're faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Forsaken, what we take when
All our lies come from the power of control

Broken down, a victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind
(Wrapped up inside your lies)

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside
That cold disguise
Behind your lies

Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow so it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow, it followed you home
And like that

Broken down, a victim of your lies

Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
And like that)
Broken down, a victim of your lies
