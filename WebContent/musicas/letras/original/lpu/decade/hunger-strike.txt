<h2>Hunger Strike</h2>
<pre>I don't mind stealing bread from the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled
But it's on the table, the fire is cooking
And they're farming babies while the slaves are working
Blood is on the table and the mouths are choking
But I'm growing hungry
I don't mind stealing bread from the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled
But it's on the table, the fire's cooking
And they're farming babies while the slaves are all working
And it's on the table, the mouths are choking
But I'm growing hungry
I'm going hungry
