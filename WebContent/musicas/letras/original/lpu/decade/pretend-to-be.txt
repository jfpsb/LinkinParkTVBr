<h2>Pretend to Be (Demo 2008)</h2>
<pre>You say that you're proud of me
Oh...
Then take somethin' out of me
So... predictable

Why do I have to see this through
Why do I have to take this
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see, you're not the one that you pretend to be 

You stuck with apologies
Oh...
Then take another shot at me
So... predictable

Why do I have to see this through
Why do I have to take this
Isn't there something I can do
To make myself finally say this

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see, you're not the one that you pretend this

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see, you're not the one that you pretend to be

[Instrumental/vocal break]

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see, you're not the one that you pretend this

No
You've taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see, you're not the one that you pretend to be</pre>
