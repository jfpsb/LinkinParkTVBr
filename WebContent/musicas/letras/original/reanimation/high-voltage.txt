<h2>H! VLTG3</h2>
<pre>Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes…

Hybrid
I’ve been digging in the crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I can start blessing it
Chin-checkin’ kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords to double helixes to show them what I’m made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
cast a spell of instrumental-ness on all of you emcees who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira
I’ve put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones
Never satisfied my rhymes jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, technicolor type-A
On highways write with road rage
pages of wind, in cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same-thing
Sing-songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Forth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Spitting raw blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Who’s the man, demandin’ your hand over your land rover?
no mans bolder when he jams your plans over
I inflict sclerosis, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye’s extremely high voltage
That’s why I need ruby-quartz glasses, cause when I glance
There’s a chance, then I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated in nano
I use skills when I need, please heed the rhyme
I heal when I bleed when I proceed through time
I walk through walls and the inanimate obstacles
By inducing the reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge you swallow a steak that’s a hologram
I box your head, fatten your lip like collagen
The telepath deliver verses with no postage
Pharoah Monch, Mike Shinoda, we high voltage

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin’ you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide</pre>
