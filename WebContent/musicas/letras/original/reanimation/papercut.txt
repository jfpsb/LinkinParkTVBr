<h2>PPR:KUT</h2>
<pre>Uh, yeah

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here’s not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia’s all I got left
I don’t know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that I watch every time I lie
Face that laughs every time I fall
And watches everything
So I know that when it’s time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

It’s like I’m paranoid looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel
Is it real or in my mind
When I found myself in places
With names but not faces
My memory races at speeds
Hundred degrees, my soul bleed
Devil must of planted the seed
Now it feels like my back’s against the wall
I’m taking the fall
Whenever I call</pre>
