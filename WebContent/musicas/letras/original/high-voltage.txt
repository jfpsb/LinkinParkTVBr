<h2>High Voltage</h2>
<pre>You know what I mean, you could probably leave all the lights down. You know what i mean?

Just do something to tell you who I am, ya know?

I’ve been digging into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
Mastered numerology and big bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
And chin checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what
I’m made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumentalness and all of the emcees
That hate us
So try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones
I fire bomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I’ve tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the guantlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage (The unforgettable sound)
High voltage (bringing you up and taking you down)
High voltage (Coming at you from memory side)
High voltage (making the rhythm of rhyme collide)

Akira
Put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
And never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
Blood type Krylon
Technicolor type A
On highways write with road rage on pages of wind
In cages of tin that bounce all around
In surround sound devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings
Overall the same things sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the tracks stand at attention
Meant to put you away with the pencil
Pistol, official, 16 line rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spin, raw raw blah blah
You can say you saw
