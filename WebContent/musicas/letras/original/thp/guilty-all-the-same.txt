<h2>Guilty All The Same</h2>
<pre>Tell us all again
What you think we should be
What the answers are
What it is we can’t see
Tell us all again
How to do what you say
How to fall in line
How there’s no other way
But oh, we all know
 
You’re guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there’s no one else to blame
 
Show us all again
That our hands are unclean
That we’re unprepared
That you have what we need
Show us all again
’Cause we cannot be saved
’Cause the end is near
Now there’s no other way
And oh, you will know
 
[Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y’all explain what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich
But the bosses’ plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
It’s insane
Even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty
At anybody’s expense
No shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free
They claim that ain’t the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say it’s time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it’s more to gain
Drained, manipulated like artists, it’s real deep
Until no more remains
But I’m still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock
’Til pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be
You feel me, we’ll see that green could be to blame
Or greedy for the fame
TV or a name
The media, the game
To me you’re all the same
You’re guilty</pre>
