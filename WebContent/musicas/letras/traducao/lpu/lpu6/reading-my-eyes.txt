<h2>Reading My Eyes</h2>
<pre>The microphone molester/machete undresser 
“Stupid-dope-fresh” type shit resurrector
Top gun/Miramar/best-of-the-best-er 
The leave an emcee-peace-in-rest-er 
The skill-tester/the flex-the-gunner 
The make-funner/the adversary make-runner 
The make summer/cold with rhymes I spit 
Kick gift to lifted delinquent wit 
I be the prophet/my hand-top it/stop it 
Fly like rocket when I rock it 
Lock it down with this perverse verse 
Every curse a burst of hurt
Move crowds/physical fitness rhymes 
Cokeheads couldn't do my lines 
I’m decorated like Christmas pines
My battalion rocks 
Emcees become silhouettes of chalk

Reading my eyes will say it in many ways 
Losing my pride will save it in many days 

Hit the dirt 'cause the words I spit 
They'll do more than just rip your shirt 
It'll bitch-slap your soul
Contact the track control/you're coming at me
You can't hack it through/so ridiculous 
Watching my crew get sick with this/wickedness
Pitching this/lyrical viciousness
To crews and cliques/made of men and mistresses
This is my life/the twilight in the fight night 
And trying to nothing but the highlights when I write
These eyes on horizons/die for my song 
Cry rhymes in Krylon/fire on
Move men telekinetically 
Esoterically beat-speaking with clarity 
Feel my verities/heroism of heresy 
And sever every emcee I see with severity 

Reading my eyes will say it in many ways 
Losing my pride will save it in many days

Why not…
What I came…

Why not…
What I came…

Why not…
What I came…

Why not/give me/what/I came to deserve?
Why not/give me/what/I came to believe?

Why not/give me/what/I came to deserve?
Why not/give me/what/I came to believe?!

Bye!
Aah!
Aah!
Ah!

Reading my eyes will say it in many ways 
Losing my pride will save it in many days</pre>
